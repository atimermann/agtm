 * This module provides a management system for rooms within a Socket.io application.
 * It supports creating unique rooms based on event names and arguments, caching room data,
 * and efficiently handling socket connections and data synchronization across clients.
 * Designed to work with Socket.io, it extends functionality for dynamic data binding,
 * caching responses, and handling real-time updates.
