 * The type of the socket event.
 *
 * `MUTATE`: Used for events that result in modifications to the data state.
 * These events can include creating, updating, or deleting data.
 * Events of this type typically trigger updates to all clients listening
 * to the affected data to ensure all users have the most current information.
 *
 * `QUERY`: Designed for events that fetch data without modifying the data state.
 * These events are used to request and retrieve data from the server.
 * Query events can be cached and may be used in conjunction with BIND events
 * to keep the frontend updated with the latest data without causing unnecessary data mutations.
 *
 * `NOACTION`: Indicates events that neither modify the data state nor fetch data.
 * These events are purely informative and might be used for logging,
 * debugging, or signaling specific states or actions within the application.
 * No action is taken in terms of data manipulation or updates, and binding
 * or triggering updates for these events is not permitted.
